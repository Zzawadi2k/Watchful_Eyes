# Eyes

## Exercise on eyes

This is another one of the exercises that I had to work on during my time with MIT xPro. It's a fun project that utilizes the mouse and it's cursor to create a kind of cool way of interacting with users or viewers such as yourself. 


## Technical Explanation
the whole point of the exercise is to make a reactive page using both CSS, Html, and javaScript.
The way this page work is by having a ball (which is someething we created using CSS) within a set area follow your mouse movement while staying in the 
boundaries of the setted area. The fun part is how we implimented it or designed it while using the principles that was just mentioned. IF you'd like to experience it yourself click on link on the top right corner of this repository or run the html file named "two_eyes.html".  

# Future Improvements
 I'd like to customize the page a bit more through CSS and other Front end coding so that I may get a more artistic like view of this whole project since it's giving me that type of artistic vibe.
