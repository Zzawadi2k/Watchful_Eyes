Eyes
## Exercise on eyes

This is another one of the exercises that I had to work on during my time with MIT xPro. 
it's quite fine, the whole point of the exercise is to make a reactive page using both CSS, Html, and javaScript.
The way this page reacts is by have a ball within a set position follow your mouse movement while staying in the 
boundaries of an area set. The fun part is how we implimented it or design it while using those said principles.
