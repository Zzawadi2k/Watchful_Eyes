# Eyes

## Exercise on eyes

This is another one of the exercises that I had to work on during my time with MIT xPro. 
it's quite fine, the whole point of the exercise is to make a reactive page using both CSS, Html, and javaScript.
The way this page work is by have a ball (which is someething we created using CSS) within a set position follow your mouse movement while staying in the 
boundaries of an area set. The fun part is how we implimented it or designed it while using the principles that was just mentioned.
